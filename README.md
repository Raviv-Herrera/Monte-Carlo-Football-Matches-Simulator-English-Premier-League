# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-English-Premier-League
Monte-Carlo simulation generator for the EPL based on xG model  

## Desciption 
In this repo I present my implementation for Monte-Carlo football match sumulation for the English Premier League (EPL). 
The simulator is based on my own logic that represents the best simulation conditions for having as much as relaistic results.
The simulator is based on several metrics:
  - xG model
  - Home & Away shots
